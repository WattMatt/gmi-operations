/**
 * Product analytics + error reporting, both no-ops unless their env keys are set, so local
 * and preview builds send nothing. Keys are an owner action (roadmap decision D8).
 *
 * Two things this module exists to get right:
 *
 * 1. Nothing is dropped while the vendor chunk loads. Both SDKs arrive via dynamic
 *    `import()`, so there is a window between `initAnalytics()` being called and the
 *    module being usable. Every public entry point queues behind the module-level
 *    `ready` promise instead of reading the SDK handle synchronously, so a `track()`
 *    fired during that window still lands.
 *
 * 2. No URL that could carry an auth token ever reaches a vendor. Supabase invite and
 *    recovery links land on `/set-password#access_token=…&refresh_token=…` (and
 *    `/reset#…`), and the fragment is live credential material until the SDK consumes
 *    it. Both vendors therefore get a scrubbing hook — see `scrubUrl`.
